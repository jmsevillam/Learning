Computation & Physics
============

Coding has become a crucial part of science in the last years. This specially because nowadays we have a power of computation which allows us to calculate things which 20 or 30 years ago was impossible. Data is now playing a very important role, as we were able to collect and create huge amount of data, the need of tools to process and analyze it became very important.


This repository has some codes using different languages. The aim of this is to be used as a training exercise and a recopilation of codes using as many languages as possible, from the most basics to more advanced stuff.

I have been programming for some years now, and most of the applications I did were done on  `Python` and  `C/C++` and it was enough for the particular problems I was facing at that time, but recently I've got interested on some other things, as learning new languages (Such as `Julia`) and Optimization/Parallelization techniques (Such as `Cython`, `Numba`, `OpenMP`, `MPI`, `CUDA`) but as usual in science, time is an issue.


## Julia Coding

Currently, it has been used to save the codes done while learning Julia. This comparing sintax with python, and then some perfomance with `C/C++`, `C++/openmp`, `python/numba`, `python/cython` is expected to be done.


### About
My name is Jose Mauricio Sevilla Moreno, I am a physicist just trying to document his experience and ideas doing computational physics. This may include some useful tips for somebody else who also enjoy code+science.
