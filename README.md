Computation & Physics
============

This repository has some codes using different languages. The aim of this is to be used as a training exercise and a recopilation of codes using as many languages as possible, from the most basics to more advanced stuff.

  - `Python`
  - `C++`


## Julia Coding

Currently, it has been used to save the codes done while learning Julia. This comparing sintax with python, and then some perfomance with C/C++, C++/openmp, python/numba, python/cython is expected to be done.
